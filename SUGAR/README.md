# SUGAR: Study Utility for Goal-oriented Academic Results

In Indian culture, sweetness is more than taste — it's tradition. From offering dahi-shakkar (curd with sugar) before exams or new beginnings, to celebrating victories with sweets, it symbolizes mangal (auspiciousness) and sets the tone for success.Scientifically too, sugar gives a quick energy boost and triggers dopamine — the “happy hormone” — which uplifts mood, sharpens focus, and builds motivation.

SUGAR, our study app, blends this timeless wisdom with modern learning psychology. Just as dahi-shakkar prepares us to face challenges with confidence, our app delivers that same mental "sugar rush" — turning study time into something sweet, exciting, and genuinely motivating.

## The Inspiration

In today's digital world, students face constant distractions. Our team noticed how difficult it had become to maintain focus during study sessions, with notifications, social media, and other digital temptations constantly pulling attention away.

SUGAR was born from the idea that studying should be:
- **Focused**: Creating environments that minimize distractions
- **Motivating**: Making progress visible and rewarding
- **Intelligent**: Using technology to enhance rather than hinder learning
- **Enjoyable**: Adding elements that make the studying experience more pleasant
